## About me
I started my career as an HTML coder with minimal skills. I was self-taught and excelled at it. I have worked with many website layouts.
A great interest in programming led me to a large team project in my city, where I continued to work independently, learning jQuery and native jscript, participated in the discussion of the implementation of new features, code optimization.
Then there were several more projects and teams. Five years ago, I took a break and devoted myself to my family. Now I want to get back to work as a front-end developer. To do this, I need to update my knowledge and get new ones. That's why I'm here
